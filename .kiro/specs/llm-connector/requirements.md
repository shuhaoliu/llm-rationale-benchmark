# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a large language model (LLM) connector feature that enables the rationale benchmark tool to connect to multiple LLM providers through a unified interface. The connector will support configuration-driven provider setup, environment-based authentication, parameter validation, and common LLM parameters across different providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and OpenAI-compatible providers like OpenRouter.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure multiple LLM providers through YAML configuration files, so that I can easily manage different provider settings and switch between them without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads LLM configuration THEN it SHALL read YAML files from the `config/llms/` directory
2. WHEN multiple configuration files exist THEN the system SHALL merge them with custom configurations taking precedence over defaults
3. WHEN a configuration file is malformed THEN the system SHALL raise a descriptive validation error
4. WHEN environment variables are referenced in configuration THEN the system SHALL resolve them at runtime
5. IF a provider configuration is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL raise a configuration validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter), so that I can benchmark across different model ecosystems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OpenAI provider THEN the system SHALL support GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and other OpenAI models
2. WHEN configuring Anthropic provider THEN the system SHALL support Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
3. WHEN configuring Gemini provider THEN the system SHALL support Google's Gemini models
4. WHEN configuring OpenAI-compatible providers THEN the system SHALL support custom base URLs and authentication
5. WHEN a provider is configured THEN the system SHALL validate the provider type against supported providers
6. IF an unsupported provider is specified THEN the system SHALL raise a provider validation error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate environment variables for API keys, so that I can ensure proper authentication before making API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL check for required environment variables for each configured provider
2. WHEN an API key environment variable is missing THEN the system SHALL raise a clear authentication error
3. WHEN an API key format is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide a descriptive error message
4. WHEN environment variables are present THEN the system SHALL validate their format without logging sensitive values
5. IF multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support common LLM parameters like temperature and system prompt, so that I can control model behavior consistently across providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a model THEN the system SHALL support temperature parameter (0.0 to 2.0)
2. WHEN configuring a model THEN the system SHALL support max_tokens parameter
3. WHEN configuring a model THEN the system SHALL support system_prompt parameter
4. WHEN configuring a model THEN the system SHALL support timeout and retry parameters
5. WHEN a parameter value is invalid THEN the system SHALL raise a parameter validation error
6. IF provider-specific parameters are needed THEN the system SHALL support them through a provider_specific section

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate configuration files at startup, so that I can catch configuration errors early before attempting to make API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate all configuration files in the config directory
2. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the file and field
3. WHEN required configuration sections are missing THEN the system SHALL list all missing sections
4. WHEN configuration merging occurs THEN the system SHALL validate the final merged configuration
5. IF configuration is valid THEN the system SHALL proceed with provider initialization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to list available models for each provider, so that I can verify connectivity and see what models are accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting available models THEN the system SHALL query each configured provider
2. WHEN a provider is unreachable THEN the system SHALL report the connectivity issue without failing other providers
3. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear authentication error message
4. WHEN models are successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display them grouped by provider
5. IF no models are available for a provider THEN the system SHALL indicate this clearly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle provider-specific authentication methods, so that I can connect to different services with their required authentication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to OpenAI THEN the system SHALL use Bearer token authentication
2. WHEN connecting to Anthropic THEN the system SHALL use x-api-key header authentication
3. WHEN connecting to Gemini THEN the system SHALL use Google Cloud authentication patterns
4. WHEN connecting to OpenAI-compatible providers THEN the system SHALL support configurable authentication headers
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide provider-specific error guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement connection pooling and rate limiting, so that I can efficiently manage API calls and respect provider limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making multiple API calls THEN the system SHALL reuse HTTP connections through connection pooling
2. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
3. WHEN rate limit errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate delays
4. WHEN concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL limit them based on provider capabilities
5. IF a provider becomes temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support configuration discovery and listing, so that I can see what configurations are available and validate my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing configurations THEN the system SHALL discover all YAML files in the config/llms directory
2. WHEN displaying configurations THEN the system SHALL show available providers and models for each
3. WHEN configuration files have errors THEN the system SHALL indicate which files have issues
4. WHEN no configurations exist THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on creating configuration files
5. IF configuration directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with example files

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot configuration and connectivity issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log request context without exposing sensitive data
3. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution information
5. IF multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL collect and report all errors together
